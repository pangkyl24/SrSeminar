Objective is to take in input from a .CSV file that has a list of attendees for an event and lists their top 5 seminars that they wish to attend. Then the code will run through the data and generate a schedule for each attendee and a schedule for the event such that each attendee's schedule will be as close as possible to their top 5 list.
